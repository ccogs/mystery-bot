# mystery-bot

Functionality is unknown, but we'll sure find it. 

Current commands:
* Any sort of greeting ("hi", "hello", "howdy", etc.)
* Any request for a cat or a kitten.
* Any request for news (including "give me fake news")

Collaboration:

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ccogs/mystery-bot` and `git checkout dev`

* Pushing to the _dev_ branch will automatically build & integrate it into the bot. 

You can message it at [m.me/justalittlebot](http://m.me/justalittlebot)
